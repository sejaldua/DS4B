	"content": "Welcome to Data Science for Biotech! How can data be used to drive forward progress in the field of biotechnology or, more generally, healthcare? Who is leading the way in the biotech industry? Can, and will, data science help find the cure for cancer? In this course, we invite students of all backgrounds to learn a little bit about a lot. You will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and neural networks in order to solve problems that matter. This class will be a fusion: we will provide a highly scaffolded tutorial of powerful data science techniques, and we will also have thought-provoking discussions that build upon the groundbreaking work already happening in the field. This course requires no technical background whatsoever. Join us as we explore the world of biotech through the lens of a data scientist!\n"
