	"content": "Welcome to Data Science for Biotech!         How can data be used to drive forward progress in the field of biotechnology or, more generally, healthcare? Who is leading the way in the biotech industry? Can, and will, data science help find the cure for cancer? In this course, we invite students of all backgrounds to learn a little bit about a lot. You will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience with data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and neural networks in order to solve problems that matter. This class will be a fusion: we will provide a highly scaffolded tutorial of powerful data science techniques, and we will also have thought-provoking discussions that build upon the groundbreaking work already happening in the field. This course requires no technical background whatsoever. Join us as we explore the world of biotech through the lens of a data scientist!    "

In order to account for the fact that we are all at various experience levels, homeworks will be progressive in nature. You should aim to tackle the first few items listed on each homework page. That being said, if you have more time, we highly encourage you dive deeper into the later items! We will suggest articles to read, videos to watch, and open source datasets to check out! Please email us if you have questions or run into problems! We are happy to help. Also email us to share your little victories!\n"

Name it \u0026lt;first name\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;last name\u0026gt;.  Click the ‚ÄúAdd a README file‚Äù button when initializing the repo. Make the repository private.   Clone the repository on your local machine. In the README.md file, please provide the following info:  Name, Class Year, Major, Hometown, Favorite Song, Favorite Food Choose 1 article from resources under ‚ÄúReading List \u0026gt; Week 1‚Äù and write down 2-3 key takeaways for next class in your README.md.   Push your changes!   Suggested/Just for fun:  Find 1 interesting Kaggle dataset for next week\u0026rsquo;s in class activity. Spend some time on Dataquest. We suggest the Data Scientist in Python track, especially for those new to coding or inexperienced with Python, but they also offer courses in R and SQL.    "
