      <description>Week 3: Data Visualization  Required:  Find 1 example of a good visualization and 1 example of a bad data visualization  Link them in your Github README!  NOTE: links in your README can be created like so [name of the visualization](paste url here)   Also in your README, briefly explain what makes the good visualization good or bad. Think about intuitiveness, data-ink ratio, color scheme, retinal variables, labeling, interactiveness, etc.</description>
