      <description>Week 1: Introduction to the Course  Required:  Create a Github account and email us your username (we will add you to our DS4B organization on GitHub) Once you are added to the GitHub DS4B organization, create a new repository (within the organization) for your DS4B coursework. Name it &amp;lt;first name&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;last name&amp;gt;.  Click the “Add a README file” button when initializing the repo. Make the repository private.   Clone the repository on your local machine.</description>

      <description>Week 3: Data Visualization  Required:  Find 1 example of a good visualization and 1 example of a bad data visualization  Link them in your Github README!  NOTE: links in your README can be created like so [name of the visualization](paste url here)   Also in your README, briefly explain what makes the good visualization good or bad. Think about intuitiveness, data-ink ratio, color scheme, retinal variables, labeling, interactiveness, etc.</description>
