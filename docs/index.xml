      <description>Week 3: Data Visualization  Required:  Find 1 good and 1 bad data visualization, link them on your Github README!  Briefly explain what makes the good visualization good or bad. Think about intuitiveness, data-ink ratio, color scheme, retinal variables, labeling, interactiveness, etc.. NOTE: links in your README can be created like so [name or description of the visualization](paste url here)   Finish your Tableau visualization.  Take a screenshot of it and upload it to GitHub (if you want to get fancy, you can embed the image in your README).</description>
