      <description>Homework &amp;laquo;&amp;laquo;&amp;laquo;&amp;lt; HEAD &amp;laquo;&amp;laquo;&amp;laquo;&amp;lt; HEAD
You will get out what you put into this course. Homework is not meant to cause stress or burnout. It is simply used as a time to roam freely as you engage with the material. In order to account for the fact that we are all at various experience levels, homeworks will be progressive in nature. You should aim to tackle the first few items listed on each homework page.</description>
