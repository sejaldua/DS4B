# Week 5: Imaging & Diagnostics [February 23, 2021]

## 1. KEY QUESTIONS
   - How can neural networks accelerate the field of biotechnology?
   - What is a convolutional neural network?
   - Will neural networks ever be able to independently make medical diagnoses?
   - What are the stakes of a neural network being wrong?
   - How do neural networks evolve as they get trained on more data?
   - How do we mitigate biases when training neural networks?
