## 3. TIMELINE

   - **5:50pm - 15 minutes:** Let folks trickle into class  

   - **6:05pm - 5 minutes:** Introductions  
        *Sejal oversees, Sook-Hee takes attendance*

   - **6:10pm - 15 minutes:** Article Group Discussion  
        *Sejal calls on people to share, Sook-Hee oversees*

   - **6:25pm - 10 minutes:** What is Exploratory Data Analysis?  
        *Sook-Hee leads, Sejal oversees*
        - Garbage in --> Garbage out
        - Data Cleaning: duplicate data, missing data, inaccurate data, incorrect data
        - Identifying Variables (brainstorm with life expectancy data)
        - Finding Correlations (heatmap)
  
   - **6:35pm - 5 minutes:** Why is Exploratory Data Analysis important?  
        *Sejal leads, Sook-Hee oversees*
        - Data is inherently messy
        - Identify errors with the data
        - Begin to understand patterns
        - Find interesting relations

   - **6:40pm - 5 minutes:** Data Types  
        *Sejal leads, Sook-Hee oversees*
       - Brainstorm: textual, wearable, geographic, temporal, spatial, qualitative, quantitative, emotive
       - Language-based data types: str, int, float, bool

   - **6:45pm - 10 minutes:** Pandas Crash Course  
        *Sook-Hee leads, Sejal oversees*

   - **6:55pm - 25 minutes**: BREAK

   - **7:20pm - 10 minutes**: Small Group Discussion  
        *Sejal leads, Sook-Hee oversees*
        - What associations do you think of when you hear the word "data"?
        - Go around in a circle and rattle of 1-2 word associations until you run out of ideas
        - Jot them down as best as you can. Then share some of your best ones with the class

   - **7:30pm - 25 minutes**: EDA Demo (using life expectancy data)  
        *Sook-Hee leads, Sejal oversees*
