## 3. TIMELINE

   - **5:50pm - 20 minutes:** Let folks trickle in and set up projector / screen-share for Zoomers  
        *Sook-Hee will introduce Soha*

   - **6:10pm - 1 hour:** Guest lecture on neural networks in bio research by Soha Hassoun 
        *Assuming Soha will leave 10 minutes for questions at the end*

   - **7:10pm - 15 minutes**: Break for snacks / dinner and socialization

   - **7:25pm - 5 minutes**: Announcements / administrative things  
        *Sook-Hee leads, Sejal oversees and helps get Zoomers checked back in*

   - **7:30pm - 15 minutes**: Discuss good & bad visualizations  
        *Sook-Hee will lead discussion of bad visualizaitons, Sejal will lead discussion of good visualizations*

   - **7:45pm - 10 minutes**: Tableau Shareout
        *Sook-Hee clicks, Sejal calls on people*  

   - **8:10pm - 2 minutes**: Verbally explain the homework >> invitation to leave or stay  
        *Sook-Hee leads, Sejal oversees*

   - **Remaining time:** Build a Tableau visualization on your own (this is part of the homework)  
        *Sook-Hee and Sejal both circulate*
