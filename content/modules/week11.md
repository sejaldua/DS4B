  - Data Ethics Film Discussions
    - **The Great Hack**
      1. Are there any benefits to social media marketing?
      2. Is all data collection unethical? Do you think psychological / behavioral analytics is net positive or net negative?
      3. Do you think that social media has shaped your political views? If so, how is that different than your closest friends and family shaping your political views?
      4. Are there worse companies than Cambridge Analytica?
      5. Do you think it’s important for everyone to have the same set of facts? Do you follow people and sources you disagree with? Why or why not?
    - **The Social Dilemma**
      1. Film subject Tristan Harris says, “if something is a tool, it genuinely is just sitting there, waiting patiently [to be used]. If something is not a tool, it’s demanding things from you, it’s seducing you, it’s manipulating you. It wants things from you.” Do you think social media is a tool for you? How might you make it one?
      2. Who do you think is responsible for solving “the social dilemma”? What should they do? Is there anything you can do?
      3. Do you find yourself unconsciously checking your phone or certain apps? Did this, or the impulse to, happen at all while watching the fim? What emotions seem to trigger this behavior?
      4. Film subject Tristan Harris posits that before artificial intelligence overpowers human strength, it will “overpower human weakness.” What does he mean by that? in what ways do you think technology has overpowered your own vulnerabilities? How is it shaping your behaviors day-to-day?
      5. Film subjects Aza Raskin and Renée Diresta have written that there’s “a difference between freedom of speech and freedom of reach.” What do you think they mean by that?
      6. Should we trust an algorithm to make major decisions such as employment, financial, or housing outcomes as well as what information we see? Is it possible for algorithms to be objective when they are written by humans, mostly white upper class Americans in Silicon Valley, who are shaped by their own biases and experiences?
      7. Do you think algorithms that prioritize outrageous and divisive content amplify hate toward minority groups? What should be done?
      8. In desperation, the family in the film uses a Kitchen Safe to lock up their screens, but this solution is short-lived. What is your family’s relationship with your devices and social media at home? Were there any moments between the film’s fictional family that felt particularly resonant?
      9. What are some concrete actions major tech companies could take to better protect children and preserve your family’s time and connection?
