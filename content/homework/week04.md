#### Week 3: Data Visualization
- **Required:** 
  - Choose your own adventure homework!
    - (A) Spend an hour working through the [Dataquest Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/course/deep-learning-fundamentals)
      - Add 2-3 sentences to your README about key takeaways related to Neural Networks and Deep Learning. 
      - If you get to the project or write some cool code, upload your code to Github!
    - (B) Make a vanilla neural network that can classify MNIST handwritten digits. Data and open source notebooks are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uoojin95/mnist-with-vanilla-neural-network) to get you started. 
    - (C) Explore MIT's free and open-source course on Deep Learning [here](http://introtodeeplearning.com).
      - Train a neural network to make music by working through [this notebook](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb)! 
    - (D) Make a copy of this [Intro to Neural Nets notebook (made by Google)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/intro_to_neural_nets.ipynb?utm_source=mlcc&utm_campaign=colab-external&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=intro_to_nn_tf2-colab&hl=en) and work through it. Don't forget to download it and upload it to GitHub when you are done!
- **Suggested/Just for fun:** 
  - Watch this [3Blue1Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) explaining how Neural Networks work
