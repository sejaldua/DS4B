#### Week 3: Data Visualization
- **Required:** 
  - Spend an hour working through the [Dataquest Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://app.dataquest.io/course/deep-learning-fundamentals)
    - Add 2-3 sentences about what you learned about Neural Networks and Deep Learning from this. 
    - If you get to the project or write some cool code, upload your code to Github!
- **Suggested/Just for fun:** 
  - Explore MIT's free and open-source course on Deep Learning [here](http://introtodeeplearning.com).
    - Train a neural network to make music by working through [this notebook](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb)!
