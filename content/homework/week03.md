#### Week 3: Data Visualization
- **Required:** 
  - Find 1 example of a good visualization and 1 example of a bad data visualization
    - Link them in your Github README!
      - NOTE: links in your README can be created like so `[name or description of the visualization](paste url here)`
    - Also in your README, briefly explain what makes the good visualization good or bad. Think about intuitiveness, data-ink ratio, color scheme, retinal variables, labeling, interactiveness, etc..
  - Finish your Tableau visualization.
    - Take a screenshot of it and upload it to GitHub.
      - NOTE: if you want to get fancy, you can embed the image in your README like so `![caption](paste url where the image lives)`.
    - In your README, write 2-3 sentences about the data you studied and anything you learned.
- **Suggested/Just for fun:** 
  - Read about our upcoming guest speaker, [Soha Hassoun](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~soha/). Explore her research in computational systems and synthetic biology. Come up with some questions to ask her at the end of her talk next week!
  - Explore MIT's free and open-source course on Deep Learning [here](http://introtodeeplearning.com).
    - Train a neural network to make music by working through [this notebook](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/blob/master/lab1/Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb)!
