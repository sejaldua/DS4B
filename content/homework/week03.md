#### Week 3: Data Visualization
- **Required:** 
  - Find 1 example of a good visualization and 1 example of a bad data visualization
    - Link them in your Github README!
      - NOTE: links in your README can be created like so `[name or description of the visualization](paste url here)`
    - Also in your README, briefly explain what makes the good visualization good or bad. Think about intuitiveness, data-ink ratio, color scheme, retinal variables, labeling, interactiveness, etc.
    - Check out the following resources if you are struggling to find your example vizzes:
      - [Tableau Viz of the Day](https://public.tableau.com/en-gb/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day)
      - [information is beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/)
  - Finish your Tableau visualization.
    - Take a screenshot of it and upload it to GitHub.
      - NOTE: if you want to get fancy, you can embed the image in your README like so `![caption](paste url where the image lives)`.
    - In your README, write 2-3 sentences about the data you studied and anything you learned.
    - NOTE: if you need help with mapping county-level data in Tableau, see [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-map-data-on-the-county-level-in-tableau-9178610cd964) article.
