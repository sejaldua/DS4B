    - Click the “Add a README file” button when initializing the repo. 
    - Make the repository **private**.

  - In the `README.md` file, please provide the following info: 
  	- Name, Class Year, Major, Hometown, Favorite Song, Favorite Food
  	- Choose 1 article from resources under “Reading List > Week 1” and write down 2-3 key takeaways for next class in your `README.md`.

- **Suggested/Just for fun:**
