#### Week 5: Imaging & Diagnostics
- **Required:** 
  - Do a critical reading of one of the following articles related to convolutional neural networks and/or medical diagnostics. Write down one thing you learned that you did not know before, one thing you feel optimistic about after having read the article, and one limitation of the proposed technology. You can pick any article you want, but here are some suggestions if you need a place to start:
    - [The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616181/)
    - [A new approach for classifying coronavirus COVID-19 based on its manifestation on chest X-rays using texture features and neural networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7513693/)
    - [“Solving” Cancer: The Use of Artificial Neural Networks in Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment](https://www.jyi.org/2017-december/2017/11/30/solving-cancer-the-use-of-artificial-neural-networks-in-cancer-diagnosis-and-treatment)
    - [Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network](https://towardsdatascience.com/plant-ai-plant-disease-detection-using-convolutional-neural-network-9b58a96f2289)
  - Do some background research on [Corti AI](https://www.corti.ai/) in preparation for our guest speaker (Nicolai Frost Jacobsen) next week. Prepare at least 2 good questions to ask him.
  - Watch [How We’re Teaching Computers to Understand Pictures](https://www.ted.com/talks/fei_fei_li_how_we_re_teaching_computers_to_understand_pictures) and write a few sentences about what you learned in your README.
- **Suggested/Just for fun:** 
  - Read some articles from the [reading list](https://datascience4biotech.com/articles/) under the Week 5 section!
