#### Deep Learning & Computer Vision

- **Required:**
  - 2-3 paragraph reflection on Nicolai's talk (in README) 
    - Deliverables (things to write in your README):
      - What is something that you learned?
      - How would you summarize Corti's use of audio-based and text-based models to a friend?
      - Given what you know about the English language (or any other languages), what do you anticipate is most challenging about Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
      - Do you trust deep learning models to process audio input in high stakes contexts (e.g. cases in which the cost of a mistake could be a human life)?
  - Choose one of the following:
    - A: Finish up computer vision demo and showcase it on GitHub via screenshots and/or code
      - Also include a 2-3 sentence explanation of what your code does, in plain English
    - B: Do a case study on Google's [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) game. This is a relevant and fascinating exploration of how gamifying computer vision / neural networks can lead to potential advances in the AI space! If you choose this route, please document your case study in your README.
      - Play the game, then write down your initial impression. Was it able to guess your drawings correctly? How many seconds did it usually take? How do you think it was able to do that?
      - Watch the [AI Experiments Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=100&v=X8v1GWzZYJ4&feature=emb_title) by Google Cloud. Provide another example of an object that would be easy for humans to recognize but difficult for a machine to recognize.
      - Check out this cool [visualization](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/purse) and click through the different objects in the dropdown menu. After glancing at hundreds (maybe even thousands) of doodles for each object in the game, which one is your favorite and why?
      - Read this [blog post](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/exploring-and-visualizing-open-global.html) and write a 1-2 paragraph reflection commenting on how this technology makes you feel? Does it make you feel hopeful or scared? Are there ethical implications? Comment on the patterns that can be seen in the data. How does bias relate to this discussion? 
      - *ONLY* if you have time and wish to dive deeper:
        - Analyze patterns with this [visualization](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/quickdraw.html)
        - Inspect the data: [The Data](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). 
        - Build a model if you are feeling inspired: 
          - [Tutorial 1](https://medium.com/tensorflow/train-on-google-colab-and-run-on-the-browser-a-case-study-8a45f9b1474e)
          - [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/keisukeirie/quickdraw_prediction_model)
  - Fill out mid-semester feedback survey! We will remind you about this before class next week.

- **Suggested/Just for fun:**
  - Watch YouTube videos about DeepFakes
  - Read articles in the Reading List under Week 6
  - Data Quest!
