## Homework

You will get out what you put into this course. Homework is not meant to cause stress or burnout. It is simply used as a time to roam freely as you engage with the material. In order to account for the fact that we are all at various experience levels, homeworks will be progressive in nature. You should aim to tackle the first few items listed on each homework page. That being said, if you have more time, we highly encourage you dive deeper into the later items! We will suggest articles to read, videos to watch, and open source datasets to check out! Please email us if you have questions or run into problems! We are happy to help. Also email us to share your little victories!
