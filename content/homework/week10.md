#### Data Ethics and Cybersecurity
- **Required:**
  - FINAL PROJECT
    - Meet with your group and submit final project proposal, group members, and links to potential datasets by email to Sook-Hee and Sejal
    - Initialize final project repo within DS4B organization
    - Invite collaborators to the repo
    - Finalized research question/motivation in README
    - Finalized dataset(s) to use and uploaded file in repository
  - Data Ethics
    - Watch either *The Great Hack*, *The Social Dilemma*, or *Coded Bias* on Netflix (Contact us accessibility is an issue for this). Write a 4-5 sentence reflection about takeaways in your README. Then come prepared for a 15 minute discussion in pods next class!
      - *The Great Hack*: How Cambridge Analytica came to symbolize the dark side of social media in the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election
      - *The Social Dilemma*: Tech experts sound the alarm on the dangerous human impact of social networking
      - *Coded Bias*: Exposes prejudices and threats to civil liberty in facial recognition algorithms and artificial intelligence


- **Suggested**
  - Begin EDA for your project
  - DataQuest!
  - Chat with your roommate / housemate / parents about data ethics! The more we talk about it, the more aware and informed we will be, which generates more noise around the topic, which ultimately leads to change! :)
