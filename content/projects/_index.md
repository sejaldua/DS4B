- Checkpoint [April 26th, 2021]
- Presentations [May 3rd, 2021]
#### Presentation Specification

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Project motivation | *Why should people care about this work? What has already been done in the field? What is your proposed novel contribution?* |
| Research question & hypotheses | *How did you think critically about the project before jumping in?* |
| Data | *Discuss the variables of interest. What cleaning did you have to do? What did you learn from exploratory data analysis?* |
| Visualization and/or ethics component |  *Walk us through some figures. Explain why you chose to visualize your findings in this way? How is each variable encoded (e.g. each racial group was encoded by colored dots on a graph)? What are the ethical implications of your work? Is anyone being left out of the dataset? If so, why?* |
| Conclusions | *Synthesize your bottom line takeaway in 1-2 sentences. If someone got lost in the technical details throughout your presentation, what is the one thing they should remember in plain English?* |
| Future Steps | *If given more time, what would your next steps be?* |
