## Proposal

**Research Question/Hypothesis:**
We don't have a specific hypothesis. Instead we will be using the Spotify 1921-2020 dataset to conduct an exploratory visual analysis via Tableau; our goal is to understand how music has evolved over time and how the popularity of different genres shifts along with that. To provide additional context around music evolution over time, we'd like to map out music/genre popularity by global region. We will be using a 2017-2018 dataset to visualize that and wrap up the "music evolution" story we'll be telling with our dashboard.

**Target Deliverables:**
1. (Potentially interactive) Tableau dashboard that tells a story about how music has transformed over the years + music popularity by region
2. Presentation of our dashboard explaining the process behind creating it, our overall goals, and what we’ve learned.
